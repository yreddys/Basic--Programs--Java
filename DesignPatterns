The Singleton Design Pattern in Java ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
This pattern is useful when you want to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object, 
which is typically the case for classes that manage resources such as database connections or thread pools. 
Here's a basic implementation of the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {

    // Private static variable to hold the single instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private Singleton() {
        // Constructor logic (if any)
    }

    // Public static method to get the single instance of the class
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        // Lazy initialization: create the instance only if it's not already created
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Other methods and variables can be added here as needed
}
```

In this implementation:

1. The class `Singleton` has a private static variable `instance`, which holds the single instance of the class.
2. The constructor is made private to prevent instantiation of the class from outside.
3. The `getInstance()` method provides the global point of access to the single instance of the class. It uses lazy initialization, 
meaning the instance is created only when needed, and subsequent calls return the same instance.

While the above implementation works well in single-threaded environments,
it's not thread-safe in multi-threaded environments. To make it thread-safe, you can use synchronized blocks or the double
